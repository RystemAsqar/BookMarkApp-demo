## Main thing what was I prove to you with this project? 
In this project I use Realtime Database from GoogleFirebase, first time... Here's what I realized by using: 

**Real-time Updates:** Firebase Realtime Database lives up to its name. One of your first impressions might be the real-time nature of the data. As soon as something changes in the database, your app instantly receives updates, making it ideal for applications that require live data synchronization.

**Simplified Backend Development:** Firebase eliminates much of the backend development complexity. You can focus on the frontend and quickly get your app up and running without worrying too much about server management.

**Easy Data Structure:** The JSON-like data structure makes it easy to organize and store data. You'll appreciate the simplicity when designing your database schema.

**Scalability:** Firebase scales automatically to handle your app's traffic. This means you won't have to stress about scaling issues as your user base grows.

**Authentication Integration:** Firebase offers robust authentication solutions. You can easily implement secure user authentication with various methods like email/password, social logins, or even custom authentication systems.

**Built-in Security Rules:** Firebase's security rules provide control over who can access your data. You'll find that configuring these rules is straightforward and essential for keeping your data secure.

**Global Availability:** Firebase has servers worldwide, ensuring low-latency access to your data no matter where your users are located.

**NoSQL Database:** If you're new to NoSQL databases, Firebase Realtime Database can be a great introduction. It allows for flexibility in your data model, but you'll also need to plan your data structure carefully.

**Integration with Other Firebase Services:** Firebase offers a suite of services that work well together. You can easily integrate Realtime Database with Firebase Authentication, Cloud Functions, and more.

**Learning Curve:** While Firebase simplifies many aspects of app development, there might be a learning curve, especially if you're new to NoSQL databases or Firebase's unique way of handling data. Don't be discouraged; there are plenty of resources available to help you learn.

**Cost Considerations:** Firebase is generous with its free tier, but as your app grows, you'll want to keep an eye on pricing to ensure it aligns with your project's budget.

**Community and Documentation:** Firebase has an active community and excellent documentation. You'll likely appreciate the wealth of tutorials, forums, and Stack Overflow threads available to help you troubleshoot any issues.
